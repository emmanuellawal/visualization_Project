# Economic Mobility Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This interactive dashboard visualizes the complex relationship between vehicle ownership patterns and housing costs across multiple states over three decades. The project combines extensive datasets on vehicle registrations, housing prices, and rental costs to provide insights into economic mobility trends.

## Key Features
- Interactive data visualization with real-time state filtering
- Comprehensive analysis of three key economic indicators:
  - Motor vehicle registrations
  - Housing price indices
  - Rental cost indices
- Dynamic charts showing temporal trends and correlations
- Responsive design with modern UI/UX principles

## Technical Stack
- React.js for frontend development
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tremor UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Key Findings

### Data-Driven Insights
1. **Inverse Correlation**
   - Strong inverse relationship discovered between housing costs and vehicle ownership
   - Higher housing costs correlate with lower vehicle ownership rates
   - Pattern particularly pronounced in urban centers

2. **Geographic Variations**
   - Urban areas show distinct patterns compared to rural regions
   - Higher housing costs in urban areas correspond with lower vehicle ownership
   - Suggests increased reliance on public transportation in high-cost areas

### Policy Implications

#### Transportation Planning
- Areas with high housing costs require robust public transportation infrastructure
- Need for integrated mobility solutions in high-cost housing areas
- Evidence supports investment in alternative transportation options

#### Housing Policy
- Data suggests need for integrated housing and transportation policies
- Housing affordability directly impacts mobility choices
- Recommendations for policy makers to consider transportation access in housing development

## Recommendations

1. **Transit-Oriented Development**
   - Prioritize development near public transportation hubs
   - Focus on affordable housing options with reduced vehicle dependency
   - Integrate mixed-use development principles

2. **Mixed Mobility Solutions**
   - Implement comprehensive mobility strategies
   - Include public transit, bike-sharing, and pedestrian infrastructure
   - Focus on reducing car dependency in high-cost areas

3. **Affordable Housing Initiatives**
   - Develop policies promoting affordable housing near employment centers
   - Focus on transit corridor development
   - Consider mobility access in housing development planning

## Conclusions
The analysis reveals a clear and significant relationship between housing affordability and vehicle ownership patterns in urban areas. As housing costs rise, residents are more likely to forgo vehicle ownership, potentially due to financial constraints and the availability of alternative transportation options. These findings emphasize the need for integrated urban planning approaches that consider both housing and transportation policies to ensure equitable access to mobility and housing options for all residents.
